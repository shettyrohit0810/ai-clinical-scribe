# Architecture Decisions Log

Running log, updated at the end of every phase. The repo is the source of
truth; if code conflicts with an entry here, the newest approved decision wins
and the conflict gets named explicitly.

## Phase 0 — Walking skeleton on real infra

**Goal:** prove the riskiest plumbing (SSE streaming through nginx + HTTPS on
EC2) before writing any product code.

- **Repo layout** — `backend/`, `frontend/`, `infra/`. Monorepo, one deployable
  unit: nginx serves the SPA build and reverse-proxies `/api` to gunicorn on
  localhost. Simple to deploy, simple to explain.
- **API prefix** — every backend route lives under `/api` so the nginx routing
  rule is a single location block and the SPA fallback never collides with it.
- **SSE smoke route** — `/api/dev/stream-test` streams numbers 1–20 at 200 ms.
  It exists solely to validate `proxy_buffering off` end-to-end before the real
  note-generation stream is built on the same transport. Kept in the repo
  (dev-only router) as evidence of infra-first sequencing.
- **Config** — `pydantic-settings` reads a git-ignored `.env` locally. In
  production, `AWS_SECRET_NAME` is set and `app/config.py` fetches one JSON
  secret from AWS Secrets Manager via the EC2 instance role at startup, cached
  in the settings object. No secrets in the repo or in systemd unit files.
- **DB engine** — single SQLAlchemy engine module (`app/db.py`) with
  `pool_size=10, max_overflow=5, pool_pre_ping=True`; rationale for each
  setting is a comment block in that file. No request ever opens its own
  connection — everything goes through the pooled sessionmaker dependency.
- **Alembic baseline** — an intentionally empty revision proves the migration
  pipeline (local Docker Postgres and RDS both reach `head`) before any schema
  exists. Phase 1+ schema changes are ordinary revisions on top.
- **Frontend scaffold** — hand-rolled minimal Vite + React 18 + TS + Tailwind v4
  (vite plugin, no tailwind.config needed). No router yet; Phase 0 is a single
  shell page (login placeholder + SSE test panel). Adding `react-router-dom`
  is proposed for Phase 1 (needs approval — outside the literal approved list).

### Interfaces established

- `GET /api/health` → `{status, database}` — used by the deploy runbook.
- `GET /api/dev/stream-test` → `text/event-stream`, 20 events then `done`.

### Deferred (structured TODOs in code)

- Real schema (Phase 1), auth (Phase 1), LLM client module (Phase 2).
